# Contributing Policy

- Respect the [GitHub Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/).

- For typos and spelling mistakes feel free to provide a fix and they will be merged as long they comply with the owner's style guide.
- For code changes always open an issue first. This will allow to determine whether or not the change should take place. The issue should be used to discuss the change.

- If the pull request is accepted the project collaborators preserve the right to fix the code style before merging the changes.

- Pull requests must target the `develop` branch. Pull requests to the `master` branch will be declined.
